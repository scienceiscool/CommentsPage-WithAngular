__Q&A:__<br>
4a. Q: Do you find the code to be simpler when using AngularJS? If so, how? If not, why?<br>
A: Yes. The code is simpler when using AngularJS because the aspects of the app are separated. It's clear what the view is supposed to do, and what the controller is supposed to do. I actually like that a lot because it simplifies the process of Web development for me.<br>

4b. Q: Would a beginner to front-end development find the code to be simpler? Why or why not?<br>
A: Absolutely. My first real experiences with front-end development were from this semester and I really like the layout of AngularJS. It's organized and it's clear where different functionality is supposed to go. Very straightforward in my opinion.<br>

4c. Q: How might the structure provided by AngularJS simplify building larger web applications?<br>
A: I think the directory structure as well as the separation of functionality would help because not everything is thrown into one place; similar, related code is distributed across files to simplify the process. Reminds me of when I was going to my EmberJS user group. We talked about this kind of thing briefly.<br>

__Prompt:__ Will come back to this.

__Status:__ Working

__Note:__ I had the Enter key functionality working a few commits ago... Not quite sure what happened. The code to support it is all there though.
